        <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> is an open-world RPG about a protagonist named Link, who has to save the princess named Zelda. 
        The game was released to the Nintendo Switch on March 3rd, 2017, and has become a revolutionary game that has redefined the open-world genre.
        It is known for its vast world and total freedom, allowing players to take their time exploring.
        In the game, players will have to fight enemies, complete shrines, and upgrade their gear. 
        There is not a linear goal or a fixed path, and players have the freedom to do any quest they like in any order.
        No matter what path you take, everything builds toward your goal of defeating Calamity Ganon.

      <p>
        Link is a Hylian, which is a race that has elfish features such as long, pointed ears. He has blond hair, blue eyes, and is canonically described as handsome. He is physically strong and is known for having a stoic, silent personality.
        Link does not have any dialogue in the game. Instead, he communicates through grunts, yells, and humming sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Link is the main protagonist of Breath of the Wild. At the beginning of the game, he wakes up in the Shrine of Resurrection after being asleep for 1,000 years.
        Shortly after waking up, he hears Princess Zelda’s voice urging him to regain his strength and recover his lost memories so he can rescue her and defeat Calamity Ganon.
        In order to do this, Link must explore Hyrule, gear up and explore ancient ruins to grow powerful enough to defeat the Calamity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the Great Calamity 100 years ago, Link served as Princess Zelda’s personal guard. Together with the Champions, they fought to stop Calamity Ganon but ultimately failed, and Link became severely injured.
        To save him and the world, Zelda placed Link inside the Shrine of Resurrection to heal, knowing he would awaken 1,000 years later to defeat Ganon.
        When Link wakes up at the start of the game, his memories are gone and he must journey across Hyrule to regain his strength and memories, confront Calamity Ganon, and free Zelda, who is holding him back within Hyrule Castle.

      <p>
        Zelda is the deuteragonist of the story. She is a Hylian and was the princess of Hyrule 100 years ago.
        She has blond hair, blue eyes, and pointy ears. She is a highly intelligent and determined person, and is burdened with the task of being the princess of Hyrule.
        She struggles with self-doubt because of her inability to unlock her divine powers, which has led her to study ancient texts in order to help her people and find a way to unlock her powers.
        While she maintains a composed and resilient personality for her kingdom, she reveals moments of vulnerability, doubt, and frustration over being unable to unlock her divine powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the Great Calamity, she fought with the Champions and Link in order to stop Calamity Ganon. However, it was unsuccessful and she had to place Link in the Shrine of Resurrection and seal Calamity Ganon away for 100 years.
        After Link wakes up 100 years later, she was the one who told Link to regain his memory and power in order to slay Calamity Ganon and free her. She sacrificed her body in order to seal Calamity Ganon for 100 years in hopes that Link will recover and save Hyrule.

    <div class="section-box">
      <p>
        Calamity Ganon is the main antagonist of Breath of the Wild. He was once a Gerudo, which are a race of desert dwelling warrior women, named Ganondorf.
        As a Gerudo, Ganondorf is tall and has a muscular build with vibrant red hair, which is a trait of the Gerudo people. He has dark skin and golden eyes and is often seen wearing armor or desert atire.
        He has a sharp face and has an air of power and elegance.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Gerudo legend, a male is born once every 100 years and is destined to become King. He was crowned the King of Gerudo at birth,
        and sought after all three Triforces. The Triforce has been split into three parts: Power (Ganon), Widson (Zelda), and Courage (Link) and have been reincarnated and fated to clash for eternity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Breath of the Wild, Ganon does not have a human form but instead has a monsterous form known as Calamity Ganon.
        Ganon has been locked up in Hyrule Castle, held back by Zelda’s power. He is the cause of the monsters and malice that has spread across Hyrule.
        His presence has corrupted Hyrule for over 100 years.

        When Link goes to battle Calamity Ganon, he has two forms: Calamity Ganon Form and Dark Beast Ganon Form.
        Link has to defeat his first form with the help of the divine beasts. When Ganon become Dark Beast Ganon, Link would have to use the Bow of Light with the help of Princess Zelda in order to slay him completely.
        After the defeat of Ganon, there will be temporary peace in Hyrule. However, the story continues in the a sequel game setting up the events of <strong>Tears of the Kingdom<Strong></Strong>.

        At the end of Breath of the Wild, Link goes into Castle Hyrule to slay Calamity Ganon and free Zelda.
        He has freed the Divine Beasts which helps weaken Calamity Ganon and has gained the powers of the champions.
        Calamity has two forms that Link has to defeat, and with the help of the Bow of Light, Link defeats Ganon and saves Hyrule.
        If you collected all of Link's missing memories, you would unlock the true ending with a bonus cutscene of Link and Zelda after the battle.

    <!-- What This Game Means to Me -->
    <h2>What This Game Means to Me</h2>
    <div class="section-box">
      <p>
        Breath of the Wild is one of my favorite games of all time.
        It captures the sense of freedom and quiet that we rarely get to experience in modern life.
        This game helps you slow down and focus on one task at a time, unlike the real world where you are continuously overwhelmed with work and responsibilities.
        You can catch your breath in this game and admire the beautiful scenery around you.
        It's a game to help you escape from your worries.
        The way the story is told, without much direct narrative, encourages players to explore and discover the story in their own way.
      </p>

      <p>
      According to Baudrillard, a pure simulacrum no longer tries to reflect the real world but becomes its own reality.
      This game can be considered a pure simulacrum because even if it has real world elements such as hunger and weather,
      it creates its own version of reality. 
      The world of Hyrule feels alive and "real" with its own kingdoms, races, creatures, cultures, and magic systems.
      The game is purely fiction and something that does not exist in real life, however it feels real because of the emotions you feel.
      It makes you remember how beautiful our world can be and how beautiful nature is, and encourages you to live in the moment, even if it is just a simulation.
    </p>
