    Link is a Hylian, which is a race with elfish features such as long, pointed ears. He has blond hair, blue eyes, and is canonically described as handsome. He is physically strong and is known for his stoic silent personality.
    Link does not have any dialogue in the game. Instead, he communicates through grunts, yells, and humming sounds.

    Link is the main protagonist of Breath of the Wild. At the beginning of the game, he wakes up in the Shrine of Resurrection after being asleep for 1,000 years.
    Shortly after waking up, he hears Princess Zelda’s voice urging him to regain his strength and recover his lost memories so he can rescue her and defeat Calamity Ganon.
    In order to do this, Link must explore Hyrule, gear up and exploring ancient ruins to grow powerful enough to defeat the Calamity.
    <br></br>
    Before the Great Calamity 1000 years ago, Link served as Princess Zelda’s personal guard. Together with the Champions, they fought to stop Calamity Ganon but ultimately failed, which made Link became severely injured.
    To save him and the world, Zelda placed Link inside the Shrine of Resurrection to heal, knowing he would awaken 1,000 years later to defeat Ganon.
    When Link awakens at the start of the game, his memories are gone and he must journey across Hyrule to regain his strength and memories, confront Calamity Ganon, and free Zelda, who is holding him back within Hyrule Castle.
