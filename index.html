    Link is a Hylian, which is a race that has elfish features such as long, pointed ears. He has blond hair, blue eyes, and is canonically described as handsome. He is physically strong and is known for his stoic silent personality.
    Link does not have any dialogue in the game. Instead, he communicates through grunts, yells, and humming sounds.

    Link is the main protagonist of Breath of the Wild. At the beginning of the game, he wakes up in the Shrine of Resurrection after being asleep for 1,000 years.
    Shortly after waking up, he hears Princess Zelda’s voice urging him to regain his strength and recover his lost memories so he can rescue her and defeat Calamity Ganon.
    In order to do this, Link must explore Hyrule, gear up and exploring ancient ruins to grow powerful enough to defeat the Calamity.

    Before the Great Calamity 1000 years ago, Link served as Princess Zelda’s personal guard. Together with the Champions, they fought to stop Calamity Ganon but ultimately failed, and Link became severely injured.
    To save him and the world, Zelda placed Link inside the Shrine of Resurrection to heal, knowing he would awaken 1,000 years later to defeat Ganon.
    When Link wakes up at the start of the game, his memories are gone and he must journey across Hyrule to regain his strength and memories, confront Calamity Ganon, and free Zelda, who is holding him back within Hyrule Castle.

      Zelda is the deuteragonist of the story. She is a Hylian and was the princess of Hyrule 1000 years ago.
      She has blond hair, blue eyes, and pointy ears. She is a highly intelligent and determined person, and is burdened with the task of being the princess of Hyrule.
      She struggles with self-doubt because of her unability to unlock her divine powers, which has led her to study ancient text in order to help her people and find a way to unlock her powers.
      While she maintains a composed and resiliant personality for her kingdom, she reveals moments of vulnerability, doubt, and frustration over being unable to unlock her divine powers.

      Before the Great Calamity, she has fought with the Champions and Link in order to stop Calamity Ganon. However, it was unsuccessful and she had to place Link in the Shrine of Resurrection and seal Calamity Ganon away for 1000 years.
      After Link wakes up 1000 years later, she was the one that told Link to regain his memory and power in order to slay Calamity Ganon and free her. She sacrified her body in order to seal Calamity Ganon for 1000 years in hopes that Link will recover and save Hyrule.
