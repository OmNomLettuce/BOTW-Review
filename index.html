  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> is an open-world RPG about a protagonist named Link, who has to save the princess Zelda. 
      Released on the Nintendo Switch on March 3, 2017, this revolutionary game has redefined the open-world genre.
      It is known for its vast world and total freedom, allowing players to take their time exploring.
      Players fight enemies, complete shrines, and upgrade their gear with no linear path—any quest can be done in any order.
      No matter the path taken, everything builds toward one goal: defeating Calamity Ganon.

  <h3>Link</h3>

  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      Link is a Hylian with pointed ears, blond hair, and blue eyes. Known for his stoic silence, he communicates through sounds like grunts and hums.
      Link is the main protagonist of BOTW. He wakes up in the Shrine of Resurrection after a 100-year slumber.
      Guided by Zelda’s voice, he must recover his strength and memories to defeat Calamity Ganon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the Great Calamity, Link served as Zelda’s personal guard. He and the Champions failed to stop Ganon, and Link was gravely injured.
      Zelda placed him in the Shrine to heal. Now, he journeys across Hyrule to restore his power and save Zelda, who has been holding Ganon back.

  <h3>Zelda</h3>
  <img src="Zelda.webp" width="300" height="400" alt="Zelda Image">
  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      Zelda is the deuteragonist. A Hylian princess with blond hair and blue eyes, she struggles with unlocking her divine powers and carries immense responsibility.
      Intelligent and determined, she studies ancient texts to protect her people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite her composed demeanor, Zelda reveals moments of doubt and frustration. She fought alongside Link and the Champions to stop Ganon but failed.
      She sealed Ganon and sacrificed herself to hold him for 100 years while Link recovered. She calls out to him to help save Hyrule.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Calamity Ganon -->
  <h3>Calamity Ganon</h3>
  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      Calamity Ganon is the primary antagonist of BOTW. A dark, malevolent force, he nearly destroyed Hyrule 100 years ago.
      Though previously sealed away, he returns in a monstrous form, spreading corruption across the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganon resides in Hyrule Castle, held back by Zelda’s power. Link must grow stronger, free the Divine Beasts, and reclaim his memories to confront Ganon in a climactic battle to restore peace.
    </p>

  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      At the end of BOTW, Link enters Hyrule Castle to slay Calamity Ganon and free Zelda. 
      After freeing the Divine Beasts and gaining the Champions' powers, Link uses the Bow of Light to defeat Ganon’s two forms.
      If players collect all Link’s memories, they unlock a true ending with an extra cutscene showing Link and Zelda after the battle.

  <!-- What This Game Means to Me -->
  <h2 class="underline-title">What This Game Means to Me</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      Breath of the Wild is one of my favorite games of all time. It offers freedom and peace rarely found in modern life.
      It encourages you to slow down and focus, letting you breathe and admire beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Baudrillard, a pure simulacrum no longer reflects reality but becomes its own.
      BOTW is a simulacrum—it contains real elements like weather and hunger, but creates a fictional world that feels alive and emotionally real.
      It reminds us of nature’s beauty and the importance of living in the moment—even if it's just in a simulation.
